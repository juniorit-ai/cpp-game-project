### 1. "Hello, World!" in C++
The "Hello, World!" program serves as the first introduction to the syntax and structure of a C++ program, showcasing how to output text to the console.

**Basic Structure of a C++ Program**
1. `#include <iostream>` - Includes the Input/Output library from the C++ Standard Library, enabling the use of `cout`.
2. `using namespace std;` - This line allows direct access to the standard library's features without needing to prefix them with `std::`.
3. `int main()` - Defines the main function where program execution begins.
4. `cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;` - Outputs the text "Hello, World!" followed by a newline. `cout` is used for console output, and `endl` not only inserts a newline but also flushes the output buffer to ensure the text appears immediately.
5. `return 0;` - Signals the end of the main function, returning 0 indicates that the program executed successfully.

**Example Code**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl; // Display message and move to a new line
    return 0;
}
```

### 2. Linux Shell Command Basics
A fundamental understanding of Linux shell commands is crucial for navigating directories, managing files, and executing C++ programs in a Linux environment.

**Navigating Directories**
1. `pwd` - Prints the current working directory.
2. `cd` - Changes the current directory.
3. `mkdir -p` - Creates directories and their parent directories as needed.
4. `ls -l` - Lists the contents of the current directory with details.

**Working With Files**
1. `touch` - Creates a new file.
2. `cat` - Displays the content of a file.
3. `cp` - Copies files or directories.
4. `mv` - Moves or renames files or directories.
5. `rm` - Removes files or directories.

**Project Build**
1. `make` - Builds and manages the project from source code.

**JuniorIT's Special Shell Commands**

1. `jcode` - Opens a file with the Code Editor.
2. `jcscript` - Runs C/C++ source code directly, similar to other scripting languages.
3. `juniorit` - Manages JuniorIT assignments.

**Code Example**
```sh
pwd                  # Print the current directory
ls -l                # List files and directories with details
mkdir -p path/to/dir # Create directory and its children directories
cd path/to/dir       # Change to specified directory
touch file.txt       # Create a new file named 'file.txt'
# Prints the string 'hello world' and redirects the output to 'file.txt'
echo "hello world" > file.txt      
rm file.txt          # Delete 'file.txt'

juniorit get         # Checks out your starter project for the assignment
jcode test.cpp       # Opens the file test.cpp in the Code Editor from the terminal
jcscript test.cpp    # Runs the test.cpp file as a script

make                 # Builds your starter project
make clean           # Removes any cached build files
make run             # Tests your starter project
make deploy          # Deploys your game to your personal website for public access
make submit          # Submits your code for review; It is the same as the command `juniorit submit`
```

### 3. Compile and Execute C++ Program
Compiling a C++ program translates the source code into an executable file, while executing runs the compiled code.

**Compilation**
1. `g++` - The GNU C++ Compiler, part of the GNU Compiler Collection. It might need to be installed on some Linux distributions.
2. `g++ program.cpp` - Compiles `program.cpp` into an executable named `a.out`.
3. `g++ -o output program.cpp` - Compiles `program.cpp` into an executable named `output`, specifying the output file name.

**Execution**
1. `./output` - Executes the compiled program named `output`.

**Code Example**
```bash
g++ HelloWorld.cpp // Compiles the code. Check for any compilation errors or warnings.
./a.out            // Executes the compiled program.

g++ -o HelloWorld HelloWorld.cpp // Compiles the code with a specified output name.
./HelloWorld                      // Executes the compiled program.
```

### 4. Output and Logs in C++
Outputting information to the console or to log files is key for debugging and monitoring program execution.

**Key Knowledge Points**
1. `<<` - The insertion operator, used to insert data into output streams like `cout`.
2. **Standard Output**: `std::cout` - Used for normal output.
3. **Error Output**: `std::cerr` - Used for error messages; outputs immediately as it is unbuffered.
4. **Buffered Log Output**: `std::clog` - Buffered logging stream, useful for log messages that don't need immediate display.
5. **Log Files**: Writing to files using `ofstream` for persistent storage of log messages.

**Code Example**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "This will print to standard output." << std::endl;
    std::cerr << "This will print to standard error." << std::endl;
    std::clog << "This is a log message." << std::endl;

    std::ofstream log("log.txt");
    log << "This will be written to a log file." << std::endl;
    log.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### 5. Comments in C++
Comments are integral for explaining the code, making it more readable and maintainable. They are ignored by the compiler and can also be used for temporarily disabling code.

**Key Knowledge Points**
1. **Single-line Comments**: `//` - Used for short comments on a single line.
2. **Multi-line Comments**: `/* */` - Suitable for longer comments that span multiple lines.
3. **JuniorIT's Special Comments**: `/*+ +*/` - These comments are for instructions to students, and the AI will ignore these comments.

**Code Example**
```cpp
/*+ 
JuniorIT's Special Comments
The AI will ignore these contents
+*/
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // This is a single-line comment
    std::cout << "Code is more understandable with comments!" << std::endl;

    /*
        This is a multi-line comment.
        It can span several lines.
    */

    return 0;
}
```
